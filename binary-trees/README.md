## Data Structure
This lab covers the creation of a binary tree and an in-order traversal function (traverses the tree left - root - right) and returns a list of the visited nodes.

The binary tree is created with two cosntructors, a Node constructor and a BinaryTree constructor.  The in-order taversal can ba called with the inOrder() function.

## Testing
The following test cases are covered: creation of a node, creation of the binary tree and the traversal function.
